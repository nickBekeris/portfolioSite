      About Me
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are many activities I enjoy to participate in, but I wont bore you 
      that long list right now. However, I have been developing and teaching 
      myself many languages for just under a decade, and using these skills for 
      others now as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Development has definitely become a passion of mine, and I plan to make a 
      success from what I am continuously learning. I currently host servers for 
      a few different video games (counter-strike & minecraft), as well as some 
      voIP servers (mumble), and development sandboxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also run a blog where I plan to keep updates of new projects as well as 
      useful information that I continue to learn.
    </p>
    
    <h2>
      Technical Experience
    </h2>
    <p>
      I have many different levels experience with a variety of different languages;
      however, recently I have been using Node.JS with different front and back
      end JavaScript libraries. I have been using the MEAN stack mostly with the
      new applications and sites in my portfolio, but LAMP stacks are an art I
      have come close to mastering as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I first started with HTML, CSS, & JavaScript back in 2007 to develop a simple
      website on a LAMP stack for a gaming group I played with and admired. Ever
      since then I have been advancing further into OOP and MVC development using
      PHP, and now AngluarJS on MEAN stacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have quickly fallen in love with AngularJS, BackboneJS, and KnockoutJS for
      creating different single page applications. This website here is running
      off of a MEAN stack with AngularJS and jQuery. You can view some more of
      the applications and languages I've used in my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a>.
